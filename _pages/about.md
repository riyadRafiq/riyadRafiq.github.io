Hi there! My name is Riyad Bin Rafiq, and I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, supervised by [Dr. Mark Albert](https://sites.google.com/view/biomed-ai/people/mark-v-albert). My research applies deep learning in the field of Biomedical application and healthcare. Within this area, I am particularly interested in developing a personalized gesture recognition system using sensor data for speech-impaired people, particularly those who lack fine motor skills. Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh.
