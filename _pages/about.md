I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://computerscience.engineering.unt.edu/) department at the [University of North Texas](https://www.unt.edu/), where I am also serving as a Graduate Research Assistant in the [Biomedical AI lab](https://www.biomed-ai.com/home). My research focuses on developing a fast and flexible gesture recognition system that utilizes wearable sensor data for individuals with motor impairments who are unable to speak. I am particularly interested in exploring transfer learning, continual learning, and meta-learning strategies for custom gesture training with a few examples. Recently, I have been incorporating large language model (LLM) reasoning to enhance adaptability and robustness in gesture recognition under limited training data. Under the supervision of [Dr. Mark V. Albert](https://sites.google.com/view/biomed-ai/people/mark-v-albert) and [Dr. Weishi Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nAPZIPsAAAAJ&hl=en), I am utilizing my expertise in deep learning and AI to make a real-world impact and improve the lives of those in need. Previously, I earned my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of North Texas and my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology in Bangladesh.
