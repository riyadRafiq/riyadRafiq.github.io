I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://computerscience.engineering.unt.edu/) department at the [University of North Texas](https://www.unt.edu/), where I am also serving as a Graduate Research Assistant in the [Biomedical AI lab](https://www.biomed-ai.com/home). My research focuses on developing a gesture recognition system using wearable sensor data for speech-impaired individuals, with the goal of improving their ability to communicate. I am particularly interested in exploring the use of transfer learning, continual learning, and meta-learning for custom gesture learning. Under the supervision of [Dr. Mark V. Albert](https://sites.google.com/view/biomed-ai/people/mark-v-albert) and [Dr. Weishi Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nAPZIPsAAAAJ&hl=en), I am utilizing my expertise in deep learning and AI to make a real-world impact and improve the lives of those in need.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology](https://www.cuet.ac.bd/) in Bangladesh. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a vision-based interpreter for Bangla Sign Language users, further solidifying my commitment to using technology for social good.
