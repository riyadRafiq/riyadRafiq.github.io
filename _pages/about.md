Hi there! My name is Riyad Bin Rafiq, and I am a second-year PhD student at the [Biomedical AI Lab](https://www.biomed-ai.com/home) in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://computerscience.engineering.unt.edu/), [University of North Texas](https://www.unt.edu/), supervised by [Dr. Mark V. Albert](https://sites.google.com/view/biomed-ai/people/mark-v-albert). My research applies deep learning in the field of Biomedical application. Within this area, I am particularly interested in **developing a personalized gesture recognition system using sensor data for speech-impaired people, particularly those who lack fine motor skills**. It will be used to generate audible responses using custom, flexible hand gestures for individuals with speech disorders. Previously, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology](https://www.cuet.ac.bd/), Bangladesh.
